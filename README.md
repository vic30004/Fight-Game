# Fight-Game

Created a Mini RPG game called battle of the bands. The player will b be able to select a band and they will have to battle against the resot of the bands. 

The game ends if the players selected band runs out of hp or the enemy bands run out of hp. 


Built With:

HTML
CSS
Javascript

Challenges

It was very interesting building this with jQuery vs Javascript. It definately saved more time, and was easier to use than javascript. This challenge showed me how to utilize object better to hold core information. What I had fun with was using jQuery to build the contents of the picture from scratch. Everything was stored in the objects, and I called on each object and added the information to HTML. 

Changing the game stats was also challenging. Eeverytime some dealt damage the new hp value had to be stored. This took a while for me to achieve but eventually it worked!
